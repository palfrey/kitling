Kitling aka “Moving Kittens as a Service”. It’s a horribly over engineered approach to noticing moving kittens (or any other video feeds you want to hand it).

It consists of a bunch of Docker containers (see the "frontend", "comparer" and "imager" folders) tied together to select the kittens that move the most. Read https://tech.labs.oliverwyman.com/blog/2015/10/29/kitten-videos-an-engineering-approach/ for further information.
